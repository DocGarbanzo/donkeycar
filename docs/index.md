#DocGarbanzo Car

Here is a description of the bespoke Donkey Car that I build on an alternative
RC car platform. 
----

Donkey&reg; Car is an open-source project for building self-driving RC cars. 
It is highly hackable and a platform for experimentation. Donkey cars are:

* Fast
* Cheap
* Out of control

The Donkey Car project and code is available here:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar)
* [Documentation](https://docs.donkeycar.com)

---------

## Car Build
The build is described [here](buggy.md).
