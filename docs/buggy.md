# Turnigy Brushless 4WD buggy

The Turnigy 1/16th 4WD Brushless Buggy is a well made RC car which comes at a 
reasonable price. The car can be bought from [HobbyKing](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-1-16-brushless-4wd-racing-buggy-w-25a-power-system-and-2-4ghz-radio-rtr.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwqqrmBRAAEiwAdpDXtFS4SQOmtAFHIMZ9HrEiBeGwMeOg9UfNnKB6_Nr-yxoUUoyarf6FORoC7NgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&___store=en_us).

I bought the buggy to build my donkey car on it. When I started with the donkey project the standard cars were not easily available in Europe. Using this buggy is for sure not as straight forward as building the _standard_ Exceed or Magnet:
* the car needs some modifications in order to be usable as a donkey car
* the modifications are an additional investment (probably more in time than in $)
* for that work you need to be happy to do some mechanical work, like drilling, using a file if you use metal, etc
* for making things neat and fitting well, it's very handy to have access to a 3D printer and use some CAD software (I'm using Fusion360). 

I am not familiar with the Exceed or Magnet car, but judging the pictures and the specs, I think that the Turnigy buggy is at least as good as the standard cars. Doing that build has been an interesting experience during which I took several detours and  made many mistakes. I could say I spent a good amount of effort in R&D but it was more like T&E (trial & error). Finally, I think I have now converged towards a good vehicle with high quality driving behaviour and a very robust architecture, so I'll share my build here. If you start a non-standard _roll-your-own_ build with another similar sized car, ie. 1/18 to 1/14 scale, the parts and approach below might work for you too. 

As I am driving the car mainly outside my goal was to build a robust car that does not disintegrate when hitting a stone or similar obstacle. Also I want to avoid dirt and/or water getting too close to the electronics.

## Parts to chuck out
The buggy comes with a small ESC and quite powerful brushless motor. According the specs it is supposed to run up to 25mph. This is probably great for racing around in the backyard but not so suitable for running donkey on it as you will require good control at low speeds. I tried a couple of laps in the garden before I started the donkey car build and it was fun to drive but hard to control (as I am no RC driver). It was also quite noisy, and the motor as well as the ESC reached high temperatures in action.

## Parts to buy
For the motor I settled with the Turnigy SK3 2836 1040 from [HobbyKing](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-2836-1040kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=CjwKCAjwwvfrBRBIEiwA2nFiPUKxThyzLSzGWZayfOwnxFth31bcAuTGR65S_pAo1QQNIYw3izbd0RoCejoQAvD_BwE&___store=en_us) This is a brushless outrunner motor with good power and lowest kV that I could find. Meaning it runs well also on lower RPMs. It also has a can diameter of 28mm, which means it will just fit into the car, whereas all the 1/10 RC motors with their 36mm can diameter will not. In order to drive the spur gear there is also a motor pinion for a 3.175 shaft required. I chose 14 teeth, 15 will fit, too. This is a standard RC part that can be bought in any RC online shop.

When I first got the motor and hooked it up to the original car's ESC I found it was not suitable either, as it required some throttle to get started and could not run on low speeds. Although the high speed was less than the original car in-runner motor. After reading that non-sensored brushless motors would not have enough passive control through a standard sensorless ESC I initially gave up on the plan to use that motor and went with a brushed motor/ESC combination instead initially. However, I found that after changing the ESC I could run the motor very well at low speeds in a very controllable way. I am using a very cheap ESC from [Ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/45-120A-ESC-Sensored-Brushless-Speed-Controller-for-RC-1-8-1-10-Car-Crawler/123836633866?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=424542043077&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649). It turns out that this works brilliantly in the combination with the SK3 outrunner motor.

So far it looks like that the motor and the ESC are not developing any heat even when going at full throttle.

## The build
### The chassis
In order to fit the motor into the original mounting bracket there is some filing or drilling required as the motor mount hole pattern of the larger SK3 motor does not fit the original holes. Here is a picture with only the chassis of the car with the motor mounted (wheels look like they are not parallel but this is somehow due to the iPhone picture optics...)

![Chassis](./assets/chassis-1.jpeg)

Here is the motor as seen from the side. In the background is my odometer disc that is mounted on the drive shaft.
![Motor mounted](./assets/motor-1.jpeg)

This is the steering servo. I had to replace it after the original servo broke. 
![Steering servo](./assets/front-servo.jpeg)

My donkey car has been involved in many crashless - mostly due reckless driving when on its own, ignoring physical obstacles and doing all kind of stubborn juvenile behaviour. Some hard crash broke the front suspension unit that I replaced w/ an upgraded metal suspension one. But long story short, donkey needs a front bumper to protect him from himself, so I made a 3D printed part (actually I made 2 parts, the first one not strong enough as donkey broke that one almost immediately, too).
![bumper1](./assets/bumper-1.jpeg)
Here is where the bumper is fixed on the upper end.
![bumper2](./assets/bumper-2.jpeg)

### The base
I decided to create a fixed base plate that is mounted to the chassis with strong joints. I also wanted a camera holder to be fixed to the frame but with the option to remove the camera from it or to remove the electronics without much hassle. Therefore I created a base plate and camera holder from 1mm sheet metal (mild steel) and a 3D-printed electronics carrier plate. The camera also has a 3D-printed case that is fixed to the holder with screws. Here are the parts:
![all-parts](./assets/all-parts.jpeg)

The base plate requires some amount of drilling hols for screws and cable openings. Here I already installed a rear aluminium angle bar for mounting the main switch and shut-down push button and screw terminals for the power distribution.
![base](./assets/base.jpeg)

This is the camera holder with a right angle slotted plate, to feed the camera cable into the housing.
![cam-holder](./assets/cam-holder.jpeg)

The electronic carrier was modelled in Fusion360, using CAD drawings for the RPi and the PCA9685 for mounting studs. It also takes the RC receiver with a push fit and a 3 Amp voltage step dow converter (push fit plus a small bit of hot glue).
![elec-carrier](./assets/elec-carrier.jpeg)

For the assembly I use 3mm hex cap head (i.e Allen) screws and beer. Washers and nuts are small and fiddly they fall down and disappear into hidden spaces, to keep your cool you use the beer. I have a whole box in all lenghts between 6mm and 40mm.

Mounting the camera holder with its angle bracket to the base plate.
![base+cam](./assets/base+cam.jpeg)

Mounting the on/off switch and connecting to terminals.
![switch](./assets/switch.jpeg)

This is the angle bracket with the switch and the small push button installed. The latter allows to shut-down the RPi through setting a specifc pin to ground. Please see Andrea [raspberry-pi-tricks](http://www.sensorsiot.org/raspberry-pi-tricks/) page.
![panel](./assets/panel.jpeg)

To mount the ESC to the base plate I 3D printed as small holder with two holes for the screws.
![esc-holder](./assets/esc-holder.jpeg)

This is how it looks with all the electronics mounted on the rear of the base plate.
![esc-mounted](./assets/esc-mounted.jpeg)

### The camera assembly
Here is a view of the camera case. The case is a 3D design where I modelled up the camera and used it as a tool to cut out the shape from a rectangular case. It mounts flush to the holder which has a hole for the lense.
![cam-case](./assets/cam-case.jpeg)

The holder assembled to the base plate and with the angular bracket attached which serves as a base for cover that is added later in the build. It also has a slot to pass through the camera ribbon cable.
![cam-holder](./assets/cam-holder.jpeg)

I made a small grommit to create a tight fit around the cable.
![cam-grommit](./assets/cam-grommit.jpeg)

### The electronics
Firstly I fitted the RC receiver into the push fit bracket on the carrier.
![rc-1](./assets/rc-1.jpeg)
This is a tight fit and will not shake loose. There is no glue or anything required. In the CAD design I made the cutout in the bracket 0.2mm larger than the measured dimension of the receiver. This required a small bit of filing. Likely 0.4mm would have worked, too.
![rc-2](./assets/rc-2.jpeg)
Next was the PCA 9685 PWM driver board which just needs pushing onto the studs. The fit is really tight too and no further fasteners are needed. Top view here...
![pca9685-1](./assets/pca9685-1.jpeg)
... and side view, here:
![pca9685-2](./assets/pca9685-2.jpeg)

Afterwards attaching the RPi to the carrier plate with screws. My intention was to use the same printed studs like for the PWM driver pcb but it turned out that Cura (my 3D printer software) had decided to make the base columns of the RPi studs hollow which resulted in the top parts braking off. So I screwed in the RPi with four 2.5mm Philips plastic screws.

Here is a view of the RPi attached and the carrier already provisionally moved into place.
![elec-all-1](./assets/elec-all-1.jpeg)

This is the whole base plate of the car. Also the voltage converter is attached now. The fit is not tight enough to hold that mini pcb inside the cutout area. I therefore put a small bit of hot glue in between.
![elec-all-2](./assets/elec-all-2.jpeg)

This is the whole car from the top. There is obviously not much space left. Making the base plate larger is also not an option as it would start fouling one of the tires if the suspension gets fully compressed.
![elec-all-3](./assets/elec-all-3.jpeg)

### Fixing and cables
There is whole for the power supply cables to the battert (in my case XT-60) plug.
![power-cable](./assets/power-cable.jpeg)

Now I fixed the electronics carrier with 2 screws to the base plate:
![carrier-fix-1](./assets/carrier-fix-1.jpeg)

![carrier-fix-2](./assets/carrier-fix-2.jpeg)

In the end I connected all cables:
* Battery+ to the voltage converter input
* Voltage converter output to RPi 5V input
* Battery- to RPi Gnd
* RPi +3.3V, Gnd, I2C SCL and SDA to PCA9685
* RPi +3.3V, Gnd and 3 channels to the RC receiver
* RPi +3.3V, Gnd and 1 channel to the odometer
As you are probably aware that the RPi has only 2 +3.3V pins - instead of making a Y-cable or adding a +3.3V power terminal, I just soldered the second row of pins to the PCA9685 and used +3.3V and Gnd from there.

![elec-cables](./assets/elec-cables.jpeg)

For the ESC switch and the 2 capacitors I didn't have any space. I might create some bracket/holder for them in the future but for now I just put them into the rear area. With so many cables around they can't get very far anyway. I also joined some cables with wires to tidy up the cable mess a little more.

### The cover
For the cover I 3D-printed a 2.4mm thick half case that fits the dimensions of the base, camera holder and rear angle bracket exactly. Again I used the technique to model up the internal parts of the base plate in one component first and then create a second component aroudn the first one making use of the useful feature 'Project Geometry' in Fusion360. I also printed upside down and avoided any overhanging parts with < 45 degree, so no support was needed. 
![cover](./assets/cover.jpeg)

The cover sits on the front angle bracket of the camera holder into which put a 3mm screw with a hex nut. There is a corresponding cut out in the cover so it fits exactly over it and I bolted it down with a small piece of sheet metal to spread the load. 
![top](./assets/top.jpeg)

This is the rear cutout area where the switch and push button are accessible.
![cutout](./assets/cutout.jpeg)

The front of the donkey car has a small cutout to supply the RPi with external power if needed.
![front](./assets/front.jpeg)

The rear of the donkey car. Obviously I couldn't wait to try out the car hence it is already dirty. Here the cover is attached to the rear suspension tower with an m4 screw, just screwd into a spacer block that sticks out on the rear of the cover.
![back](./assets/back.jpeg)

With the cover on, there is no way any dirt or water can get into the electronics and it keeps them reasonably shielded from physcial impacts. All in all the whole construction now also feels rigid enough for hopefully many rounds of _fast_ and _out-of-control_ driving.

### To do
1. Obviously when running an outrunner motor there is no need to use an odometer on the drive shaft any longer that has a disk with embedded neodym magnets. You get a much higher angular resolution when placing the hall sensor (I am using a bipolar latching SS460S) directly next to the rotating can of the motor. I will do this at some point.

1. The ESC and the motor are both specified for 3S so I could run the car at more power. Will try.

1. The spur gear is made of plastic and I chewed through already 2 of those. I had ordered a metal one from Ebay some months ago but it never showed up. I believe I will need a metal drivetrain throughout.

1. I will probably also fit some sort of mini OLED display for showing battery charge and processor temperature or similar.
